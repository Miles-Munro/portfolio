# Hi, I'm Miles Munro

I'm a data-focused graduate based in Melbourne, Australia with a background in Econometrics and Advanced Computer Science from Monash University (2025).

I'm interested in using data to understand behaviour, evaluate decisions, and support practical business outcomes. My academic background combines statistical rigour with software development, allowing me to move comfortably between quantitative modelling and implementation.

# Skills & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
- **Analytics & Visualisation:** Power BI, Excel  
- **Core Areas:** Regression, Time Series, Forecasting, Machine Learning  
- **Foundations:** Statistics, Quantitative Analysis, Database Management  

# Current Focus
I'm currently strengthening my practical analytics portfolio by building end-to-end projects, from data acquisition, scraping and cleaning through to modelling, visualisation and analysis, with an emphasis on reproducibility, clarity and ethical data management.

My goal is to develop into a well-rounded data professional who can contribute to decision-making and analysis.

# Beyond Work

Outside of data, I'm interested in history, philosophy, astronomy, and staying fit and healthy.
